This protocol outlines the required reagents and step-by-step procedures for performing Orion imaging followed by GeoMx spatial
transcriptomics on the same tissue section. This was originally described in the publication “Same-Slide Spatial Multi-Omics Integration
Reveals Tumor Virus-Linked Spatial Reorganization of the Tumor Microenvironment”, with modifications adapted from protocols provided
by RareCyte (Orion) and Bruker Corporation (GeoMx). Please cite when using this protocol.
